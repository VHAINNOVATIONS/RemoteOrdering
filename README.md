The purpose of this project is to create a seamless electronic method for providers to enter and review laboratory and radiology orders for Veterans, regardless of where they are aligned. 

The goal of the first phase of the project is to create a functional prototype in a development / test environment. 

The specific objectives are:

1.To create a functional prototype and perform user acceptance testing, in the Innovation FTL with the following functionality: 

 a. Ability to enter orders for laboratory and radiology testing at the local site for completion at a remote site
 
 b. Ability to run a report for the local site and remote sites that captures an itemized list of what laboratory tests 
    were completed at another site and for which patients
    
 c. Ability to exchange patient sensitive information between VA sites in a secure manner in accordance with standard VA 
    regulations for privacy
    
 d. Ability for locally entered orders to be received and acted upon by the appropriate departments at the remote site
 
 e. Ability to generate view alert to the ordering provider when the results are available for viewing
 
 f. Ability for remote sites to contact the ordering provider for critical alerts

2.To perform user functionality testing in a production environment in Durham, NC and Indianapolis, IN.

Note:  As of 15 December 2015 Indianapolis IN will not be included in the pilot.
